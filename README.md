This project is an emulator for the CHIP-8 system, developed in C++ as part of an in-depth study of computer architecture. CHIP-8, an interpreted system from the 1970s, is often used to explore basic concepts of emulation and game programming. This emulator provides a platform for experimentation and learning, accurately recreating the functionalities of CHIP-8. It is ideal for computer science students and enthusiasts interested in understanding the internal mechanics of classic computer systems.
